# Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark
This [course](https://www.udemy.com/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark) is offered by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseporitlla/]) on Udemy.

## Program Description

**Learn the latest Big Data Technology - Spark! And learn to use it with one of the most popular programming languages, Python!**

One of the most valuable technology skills is the ability to analyze huge data sets, and this course is specifically designed to bring you up to speed on one of the best technologies for this task, **Apache Spark**! The top technology companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, Amazon, NASA, and more are all using Spark to solve their big data problems!

Spark can perform up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce, which has caused an explosion in demand for this skill! Because the **Spark 2.0 DataFrame** framework is so new, you now have the ability to quickly become one of the most knowledgeable people in the job market!

This course will teach the basics with a crash course in Python, continuing on to learning how to use Spark DataFrames with the latest Spark 2.0 syntax! Once we've done that we'll go through how to use the MLlib Machine Library with the DataFrame syntax and Spark. All along the way you'll have exercises and Mock Consulting Projects that put you right into a real world situation where you need to use your new skills to solve a real problem!
